🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used

🔹 Power BI Desktop – For building reports and dashboards.

🔹 Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation.

🔹 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Advanced calculations and measures.

🔹 SQL (Optional) – For extracting and managing data.

🔹 Excel – Data preprocessing and initial analysis.





📊 Key Features of the Project

1️⃣ Data Extraction & Transformation

Imported Adventure Works dataset from an Excel file into Power BI.

Cleaned and structured raw data using Power Query.

Applied transformations such as data type conversion, column renaming, missing value handling, and relationship management.


2️⃣ Data Modeling & Relationships

Created relationships between tables like Sales, Customers, Products, and Geography.

Used Star Schema modeling to optimize data performance and improve query efficiency.

Established primary and foreign key relationships for accurate reporting.

3️⃣ DAX Calculations & Measures

Created calculated columns and measures using DAX to perform complex calculations.

Example measures:

Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Revenue])

Profit Margin % = ([Total Profit] / [Total Sales]) * 100

YOY (Year-over-Year) Growth % = [(Current Year Sales - Previous Year Sales) / Previous Year Sales] * 100

Used Time Intelligence Functions to analyze trends over time.

4️⃣ Interactive Dashboards & Reports

Created multiple Power BI dashboards with the following insights:

✔ Sales Overview – Total revenue, profit, and sales trends over time.

✔ Customer Analysis – Age group distribution, location-based segmentation, and purchasing patterns.

✔ Product Performance – Best-selling products, least-performing categories, and revenue contribution.

✔ Geographical Analysis – Regional sales performance and customer distribution across countries.

✔ KPIs & Filters – Implemented dynamic filters, slicers, and drill-through reports for better interactivity.

5️⃣ Assignments & Solutions

To make learning more practical and effective, the project includes assignments and their solutions, covering:

📌 Data Cleaning Challenges – Handling missing values, duplicates, and data formatting issues.

📌 DAX Formulas Practice – Creating measures for sales trends, cumulative sales, and ranking products.

📌 Dashboard Creation Tasks – Designing custom dashboards with various visualization techniques.

📌 Real-World Scenarios – Answering business questions using Power BI insights.
